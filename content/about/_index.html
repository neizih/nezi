I'm a 20-year-old from Costa Rica who loves computers, music, and video games.

I'd like to talk more about this page though. The first time I saw a website like this was from Bugswriter. I had never thought about the idea of having your own space on the internet where you can do whatever you want for so little money! I just need more creativity. Almost every personal website has the same home, about, and blog pages, and after some websites, it gets boring. The problem is, I'm not creative at all.

For now, I have a trips section. I'm planning on going to big mountains someday, and I'd like to document every trip. I will also have a recipes section, even though I don't know how to cook yet. I hope that section makes me learn how to cook.

That's it for this page. I hope you like it. Please suggest cool stuff and content through my Discord or email.
