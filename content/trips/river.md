It was a Sunday, me and my family went to a small waterfall. It took a looong time to get there. Here's a picture of that waterfall:

It was so beautiful irl, camera will never capture how real and beautiful it is. We have been on rivers before but I never really swimmed in them, river water is always freezing and I didn't like that. This time tho, I was standing on a rock for a good while deciding on weather taking the leap or not. 

I jumped into the river, water was freezing but it felt so good, I got like a hit of adrenaline. We had a great time, we laughed, we talked, and my brother did crazy stuff as usual. It was really fun. 

For a lot of years I never took these trips with my family, I always prefered staying at home playing ds3, which is so dissapointing but that's my old me. Tbh I didn't wanna take this trip either but I finally realized my parents really always wanted me and my brothers to be there. I'm so glad I said yes, I now have a great memory I will never forget cuz this trip made me remember how fortunate I am. I can't be more grateful, I can't ask for more. I've been very stupid but it's never too late to change.

Hug your parents.

Thx for reading.
