It was a Sunday, and my family and I went to a small waterfall. It took a long time to get there. Here's a picture of that waterfall:

It was so beautiful in real life, and it felt very real too. If you've been chronically online for a while, then going outside can make things feel and look too real. We had been on rivers before, but I had never really swum in them because of how cold they are. This time, though, I just jumped in. Water was freezing, but it felt so good this time. We had a great time, laughing, talking, and my brother doing crazy stuff as usual. It was really fun.

For many years, I never took these trips with my family for no valid reason. To be honest, I didn't want to take this trip either, but I finally realized that my parents always wanted me and my brothers to be there. I'm so glad I said yes; now I have a great memory for the rest of my life. This trip made me remember how fortunate I am. I can't be more grateful; I can't ask for more. I've been very stupid, but it's never too late to change.

Hug your parents.

Thanks for reading.
